<h2>About</h2>
<p>These author services maps show the various services that Wiley offers Researchers across the research journey &ndash; from discovery through to assessment. There is an <a href='{{ "/interactive-graphic/" | relative_url}}'>Interactive Map</a> which allows you to click through each stage of the author journey and see the services, including a brief description.&nbsp;Use the static map (infographic link) to show an overview of the entire author journey and the services offered, or use the power-point summary (link) for presentations.&nbsp;Click on the relevant graphic for more information.</p>
<p>Only the best work is accepted by our journals, but we make everything else easy. From article preparation to peer review, to production, to promotion, Wiley is with authors, reviewers and editors every step of the way.</p>
<p>It all starts with<strong> quality</strong>. Wiley&rsquo;s peer review and ethical standards have made us a trusted name for over 200 years. But we never stop looking to the future as we regularly pilot and launch new services for our authors, reviewers and editors. So when an article appears in a Wiley journal, you can be sure it is the best possible version of the work.</p>
<p>But an article cannot change the world if nobody sees it. So <strong>reach</strong> is vital. And there are &gt;20 million full-text accesses every month on Wiley Online Library. Authors have the choice to make their work available to all through Wiley&rsquo;s open access program. Publishing with Wiley means authors have a global platform.</p>
<p>In the end, though, it&rsquo;s <strong>impact </strong>which makes reputations and builds careers. 1,200 of our journals have an Impact Factor (including 24 journals ranked number 1) and 53% of Wiley journals increased their Impact Factor this year.</p>
<p><strong>Ease, Quality, Reach</strong> and <strong>Impact</strong> are the four reasons why over 500,000 researchers every year, and more than half of the Nobel Laureates who have ever lived, chose Wiley to publish their work.</p>
