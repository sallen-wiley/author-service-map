<h2>About</h2>
<p>These author services maps show the various services that Wiley offers Researchers across the research journey – from discovery through to assessment. There is an <a href="https://wileycreativeservices.github.io/author-service-map/interactive-map/">Interactive Map</a> which allows you to click through each stage of the author journey and see the services, including a brief description. The <a href="https://wileycreativeservices.github.io/author-service-map/powerpoint-map/">PowerPoint Summary</a> shows an overview of the entire author journey and the services offered (with embedded links) and is available to use for presentations or to save as a PDF. Click on the relevant graphic for more information. The Competitor Maps page (coming soon) will show what services other publishers are currently offering.</p>
